# AssignmentsPFLab07
This repository contains assignments of the PF Lab 07 handout.

## Classwork:-
It consists of the following:-
<br>**Linear Search Program**
<br>**Q1.** Write a C Program that takes an user input array and prints the sum of its elements. <br>Input: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} <br>Output: 45
<br>**Q2.** Write a program in C to read n number of values in an array and display it in reverse order<br>Input: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}<br>Output: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
<br>**Q3.** You are developing a user input validation system for a registration form. The form requires the user to input their name, email, and phone number. Validate the inputs with the following rules:
<br>Name: Can only contain alphabetic characters (A-Z, a-z), spaces.
<br>Email: Can contain alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), periods (.), underscores (_), hyphens (-), and must include an @ symbol.
<br>Phone Number: Can contain digits (0-9), spaces, hyphens (-), and an optional plus sign (+) at the beginning.

## Assignment 07:-
It consists of the following:-
<br>**Q4.** Write a C Program to find the minimum and maximum number in an array.
<br>Input:{4,1,6,8,10,21,8,9,2,6}
<br>Output:
<br>Minimum Number = 1 Maximum Number = 21
<br>**Q5.** A weather station records temperature in an array over the course of a week (7 days). Write a program that calculates the average temperature of the week and identifies if any days had extreme temperatures (above 40°C or below 0°C).
<br>Example Input: [25, 30, -2, 35, 42, 28, 10]
<br>Example Output: Average temperature: 24.0°C, Extreme temperatures on day 3 and day 5.
<br>**Q6.** Given an array arr[] of size N which contains elements from 0 to N-1, you need to find all the
elements occurring more than once in the given array.
<br>Input:
<br>Array Size =5
<br>Element 1=2
<br>Element 2=3
<br>Element 3=1
<br>Element 4=2
<br>Element 5=3
<br>Output:
<br>Number 2 and 3 in array occur more than once.
<br>Note: You cannot utilize nested loops.
